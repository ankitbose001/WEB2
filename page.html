            Flutter apps are written in the Dart language and make use of many of the language's more advanced features.[9]
            
            On Android, and on Windows, macOS and Linux via the semi-official Flutter Desktop Embedding project, Flutter runs in the Dart virtual machine which features a just-in-time execution engine. Due to App Store restrictions on dynamic code execution, Flutter apps use ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation on iOS.[10]
            
            A notable feature of the Dart platform is its support for "hot reload" where modifications to source files can be injected into a running application. Flutter extends this with support for stateful hot reload, where in most cases. </div></div>

    <div class="text1">Widgets
        UI design in Flutter typically involves assembling and/or creating various widgets. A widget in Flutter represents an immutable description of part of the user interface; all graphics, including text, shapes, and animations are created using widgets. More complex widgets can be created by combining many simpler ones.
        
        However, the use of widgets is not strictly required to build Flutter apps. An alternative option is to use the Foundation library's methods directly, interfacing with "canvas" commands to draw shapes, text, and imagery directly to the screen. This property of Flutter has been utilized in a few frameworks, such as the open-source Flame game engine.
